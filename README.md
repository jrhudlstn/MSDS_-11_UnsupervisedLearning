# Description of the Call Detail Records (CDRs) generated by the Telecom Italia cellular network over the city of Milano
The dataset provides information about the telecommunication activity over the city of Milano. The dataset is the result of a computation over the Call Detail Records (CDRs) generated by the Telecom Italia cellular network over the city of Milano. CDRs log the user activity for billing purposes and network management. CDRs log the user activity for billing purposes and network management. There are many types of CDRs from the data spource Open Database License (ODbL) Telecommunications - SMS, Call, Internet - MI https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EGZHFV .

Square id: The id of the square that is part of the city GRID.
Time interval: The beginning of the time interval expressed as the number of millisecond elapsed from the Unix Epoch on January 1st, 1970 at UTC. The end of the time interval can be obtained by adding 600000 milliseconds (10 minutes) to this value.
Country code: The phone country code of a nation. Depending on the measured activity this value assumes different meanings that are explained later.
SMS-in activity: The activity in terms of received SMS inside the Square id, during the Time interval and sent from the nation identified by the Country code.
SMS-out activity: The activity in terms of sent SMS inside the Square id, during the Time interval and received by the nation identified by the Country code.
Call-in activity: The activity in terms of received calls inside the Square id, during the Time interval and issued from the nation identified by the Country code.
Call-out activity: The activity in terms of issued calls inside the Square id, during the Time interval and received by the nation identified by the Country code.
Internet traffic activity: The activity in terms of performed internet traffic inside the Square id, during the Time interval and by the nation of the users performing the connection identified by the Country code.
Call Detail Record (CDR) is the information captured by the telecom companies during the Call, SMS and Internet activity. This informationâ€™s provides insights about the customer needs when it is used with customer demographics. 

Most of the telecom companies using call detail record information in the fraud detection by clustering the user profiles, Customer churn by usage activity and targeting the profitable customers by using RFM analysis.

Data Description:
The datasource used here is daily activity file from dandelion API. These are the CDR records generated by the Telecom Italia cellular network over the city of Milano. Daily CDR activity file contains information for 10000 grids about SMS in and out, Call in and out and internet activity.  CDR activity file contains information for 10, 000 grids about SMS in and out, Call in and out, and Internet activity 

## Introduction
telecom companies use CDR information for fraud detection by clustering the user profiles, reducing customer churn by usage activity, and targeting the profitable customers by using RFM analysis.
## Business need
clustering of the customer activities for 24 hours by using unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm. It is used to understand segment of customers with respect to their usage by hours.

For example, customer segment with high activity may generate more revenue. Customer segment with high activity in the night hours might be fraud ones.
